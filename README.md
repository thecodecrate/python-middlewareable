# Python-Middlewareable

A simple library for working with middlewares in Python.

## Installation

```bash
pip install python-middlewareable
```

## Usage

### 1. Define a payload structure

```python
@dataclass
class Request(RequestBase): # inherit from RequestBase
    name: str
```

### 2. Create a middleware

```python
class OneMiddleware(MiddlewareBase[Request]):
    async def handle(
        self, request: Request, next_call: MiddlewareNextCallBase[Request]
    ) -> None:
        request.name = request.name + " from OneMiddleware"

        print("OneMiddleware before")
        await next_call(request)
        print("OneMiddleware after")

```

### 3. Add the `MiddlewareableBase` trait to the class that will use the middlewares

```python
class App(MiddlewareableBase[Request]):
    middlewares = [OneMiddleware] # add your middlewares here
```

### 4. Instantiate and use it

```python
# middlewareable
app = App()

# process request
result = await app.process_middlewares(Request(name="Hello"))

# check the result
print(request)

# output:
# OneMiddleware before
# OneMiddleware after
# Hello from OneMiddleware
```

## Traits

You can use the following traits to extend the functionality of your classes:

- [AutoInstantiable](src/python_middlewareable/traits/auto_instantiable)
- [DataStructurable](src/python_middlewareable/traits/data_structurable)
